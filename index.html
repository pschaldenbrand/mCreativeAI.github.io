                    <p>
                        The idea of applying AI to creative endeavors activates the games/vfx industries, artists, manufacturing, tech
                        company labs, and academics, but much of what is published on the topic shows there is still a great degree of
                        siloing within these various fields. SIGGRAPH is an ideal context for these diverse constituencies to develop
                        shared perspectives on goals, outcomes, and metrics for this emerging field.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This half-day workshop for SIGGRAPH pulls from the industries above to give a wide view on what "creative AI"
                        means in practice and what people's goals and aspirations are in the space. Framed with panel discussion from
                        field experts, we will conduct a hands-on session around "measurable" goals to collaboratively define, apply, and
                        iterate on metrics for evaluating creative AI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This workshop aims to bring people together to talk about common goals (the "Measurable" part of the workshop title) and objectives
                        in this space as well as inform the direction that researchers take when
                        developing creative AI tools, and potentially form the foundation for new collaborative relationships.

                    <div>While the methods for producing machine creativity have significantly improved, the discussion on a scientific consensus on measuring the creative abilities of machines has only begun. As Artificial Intelligence becomes capable of solving more abstract and advanced problems (e.g., image synthesis, cross-modal translations), how do we measure the creative performance of a machine? In the world of visual art, subjective evaluations of creativity have been discussed at length. In the CVPR community, by comparison, evaluating a creative method has not been as systematized. Our goal in this workshop is to discuss current methods for measuring creativity both from experts in creative artificial intelligence as well as artists. We do not wish to narrow the gap between how humans evaluate creativity and how machines do, instead we wish to understand the differences and create links between the two such that our machine creativity methods improve.</div>

                    <div>How do we make a creative machine? This workshop follows a series of studies conducted in the classroom setting at CMU and UC San Diego. For ISEA, participants will collectively find a definition of creativity specific to machines, addressing follow up questions: Can we computationally model ambiguity? Would a novelty search result in valuable discoveries? Where is the threshold between randomness and creativity? How do we evaluate the creativity of an algorithm? To answer these questions, participants develop sets of criteria to assess their own and peer groupsâ€™ creative AI and ML projects. Although such a human-centered method is subjective, we anticipate discovering ways to describe and interpret dimensions of algorithmic creativity. This half-day workshop engages a broader arts and machine learning community to collaboratively define these quantitative criteria, in a first attempt to collectively establish evaluation metrics for the area of creative AI.</div>
