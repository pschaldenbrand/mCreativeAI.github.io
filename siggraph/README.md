## Measurable Creative AI [SIGGRAPH 2021](https://s2021.siggraph.org/)

### August 2021 - On Demand and Live Discussion August 11

[Speakers](#invited-speakers) |  [Questions](#questions) |  [Organizers](#organizers)

SIGGRAPH 2021 is a virtual event and this workshop will be conducted online. Our invited speakers will provide prerecorded video talks and participate in live panel discussions. [Live Q&A on August 11, 20201, 9-10am PDT](https://s2021.siggraph.org/presentation/?id=fwkp_105&sess=sess243).

# Abstract

The idea of applying AI to creative endeavors activates the games/vfx industries, artists, manufacturing, tech
company labs, and academics, but much of what is published on the topic shows there is still a great degree of
siloing within these various fields. SIGGRAPH is an ideal context for these diverse constituencies to develop
shared perspectives on goals, outcomes, and metrics for this emerging field.

This half-day workshop for SIGGRAPH pulls from the industries above to give a wide view on what "creative AI"
means in practice and what people's goals and aspirations are in the space. Framed with panel discussion from
field experts, we will conduct a hands-on session around "measurable" goals to collaboratively define, apply, and
iterate on metrics for evaluating creative AI. Partnering with the Art Gallery and Art Papers programs, we have
unique subjects for this analysis drawn from the creative projects present at the conference.

This workshop aims to bring people together to talk about common goals (the "Measurable" part of the workshop title) and objectives
in this space as well as inform the direction that researchers take when
developing creative AI tools, and potentially form the foundation for new collaborative relationships.

# Format

This workshop will consist of a combination of pre-recorded presentations along with a one hour long live panelist discussion.

## Questions

__On The Subjectivity of Evaluation:__ Evaluating a creative work can be considered subjective. Can/should we account for this
subjectivity in our evaluation of artificially intelligent creative systems? Or should we strive for objective measures of creative
success?

__On Context in Evaluation:__ Evaluating creative work is dependent on history. When evaluating a creative work, can we account for
bodies of work that have come before it?

__On Explainability of Evaluation:__ How important is intelligibility of the evaluation of creative work? Can we have evaluation measures
that do not clearly explain themselves?

__On Parts of Creativity for Evaluation:__ Novelty, surprisingness, value, etc. can be considered aspects of creativity. Can these aspects
be enumerated and defined, or are there mysterious qualities to creative work? Does a work need to have each aspect to be
considered creative? If not, can the relationship between the presence of these aspects in a work be mapped out systematically?

__On Uses:__ What can we do with creative AI evaluation measures? Say we have an incredible AI creativity evaluation function today:
what should we do with it?

__On Value:__ Do you find that research into evaluating creativity is valuable? In what ways do you see this research contributing to
culture or knowledge?
